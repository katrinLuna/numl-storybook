# What is NUDE Framework?

**NUDE** is the heart of **Numl**. It's framework to create style-oriented **Custom Elements** with vast number of features like:

* Real CSS inheritance between elements
* Multiple options for flexible element customization
* Optimized CSS Generation algorithms
* Context-sensitive styling and logic
* Built-in Variables and Custom Properties support
* Multiple tools for styling, coloring and accessibility
* Transparent Shadow DOM Support

**NUDE** helps you create rich-styled elements without using CSS. It has its own style definitions. Also it has **life-cycle** hooks and convenient **Context System**. It drastically simplifies element development.

**NUDE** provides no tools for element composition and state management. It's still possible to use **NUDE** with other tools that can fill that gap. This simplicity of architecture helps framework to be highly compatible with other popular JS-frameworks.
